# Autoware-with-Carla-creating-bridge-with-ROS2

This project establishes a **bridge** between the **CARLA Simulator (v0.9.15)** and **Autoware** using **ROS 2**.  
It allows sensor data, vehicle control commands, and simulation information to be exchanged seamlessly between CARLA and Autoware, enabling autonomous driving experiments in a high-fidelity simulated environment.
